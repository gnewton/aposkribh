All libraries:
1 - Load dependencies (other aposkribh dependencies) by loading
    init.ps with their filename (string) and an array of the filenames of
    the libraries they want to load.
    Example: First line of args.ps:
      (args.ps) [(globals.ps)] (init.ps) run
    This loads "globals.ps".
    - init.ps tracks the loading of libraries so they are only loaded
    once.
2 -
